# BeerTynder

## About

This is a mobile app based off the popular dating app, Tinder. Our application allows users to swipe through randomly generated beers from around the world, view detailed information about those beers, and add to personal lists. By tapping the "Social" tab, users can view other users' selected beers and add to their own wishlists. Users can also search from the BreweryDB (http://www.brewerydb.com/) database of beers to add a beer manually. This is a collaborative project with other Nashville Software School students.
